Implemented in OpenGL. Every object seen is procedurally generated. From the paintings, rooms, and center sculptures. Every time you run it, you get a different art gallery.

[See On Github](https://github.com/tucci/comp442-compiler)

## Features
- Procdural Generation of rooms, paintings, and sculptures in the middle of the room
- Smooth Collision Handling (No stopping when hitting a wall, Smooth wall glide)
- Lighting of all objects
- Texturing (diffuse, normal, specular, and height maps for each texture)
- Debug Overlays/Tools

## The Outcome
